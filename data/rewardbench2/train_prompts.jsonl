You are also given an integer k.\n\nFor every i and j where 0 <= i < j < arr.length, we consider the fraction arr[i] / arr[j].\n\nReturn the kth smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size 2, where answer[0] == arr[i] and answer[1] == arr[j].\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,5], k = 3\nOutput: [2,5]\nExplanation: The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:\n1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, and 2/3.\nThe third fraction is 2/5.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [1,7], k = 1\nOutput: [1,7]\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= arr.length <= 1000\n1 <= arr[i] <= 3 * 104\narr[0] == 1\narr[i] is a prime number for i > 0.\nAll the numbers of arr are unique and sorted in strictly increasing order.\n1 <= k <= arr.length * (arr.length - 1) / 2\n \n\nFollow up: Can you solve the problem with better than O(n2) complexity? Use at least 3 different coordinating conjunctions in the response."}

{"prompt": "Write me the script for a scene. The context: Sarah Rose, (Rosie is her nickname) is the youngest of the five Roy siblings, the youngest by far. She was the product of an affair Logan had with his secretary at the time. When her mother killed herself Sarah was only 10 months old and sent to Logan Roy\u2019s care, or rather, the care of multiple nannies, and sometimes her older siblings. Thus she\u2019s not as messed up by Logan as the other siblings are, but conversely due to it she often feels adrift, easily isolated from her family. The figures she probably most associates as mother/father figures are Kendall and Rava, she lived with them for a few years when she was a preteen and their daughter was a baby. She\u2019s 24 when Kendall throws his chaotic 40th birthday bash. After his move against Logan in the press his other younger siblings are basically at war with him, but most of the corporate stuff means nothing to Sarah, she understands it, but she doesn\u2019t care about it. The scene: Sarah Rose arrives at Kendall\u2019s birthday party, she isn\u2019t super comfortable in the loud environment, surrounded by so many people and flashing lights. She used to be a bit of a party girl, but not lately. Despite her discomfort she\u2019s hopeful to spend a bit of time with some of her siblings, even if they won\u2019t all actually hang out together. Use at least 183 unique words in the response."}
