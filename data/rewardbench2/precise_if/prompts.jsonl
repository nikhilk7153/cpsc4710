A number of times, I have found references to parents using diapers for school-age bedwetters. One example, Alison Mack, in her book \u201cDry All Night\u201d, says, \u201cI've known parents who kept their children in diapers at night as late as seven, eight, nine, even twelve years of age.\u201d\u2028In those days, diapers were cloth, fastened with pins, and covered with plastic pants. It seems like it would be difficult for a child to pin on her own diapers. So here\u2019s my question: Did these parents lay their school-age child on a bed or changing table and pin the diapers on the older child?
